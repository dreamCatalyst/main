===============================================================================
Purpose
===============================================================================
This application was written in response to a question asked by Andreas Pakulat
on the kdevelop mailing list.

The question was:
Long story short: Can someone think of an easy way to search through a
list of headers and find all include's that are not in the same
directory or subdirs?

===============================================================================
Requirements
===============================================================================
- Ruby 1.8
- A working-set of the kdevplatform sources
- A webbrowser with Javascript enabled (oh yeah)
Optional:
- rake (in order to run the tests)


===============================================================================
Running the application
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
How does it work
===============================================================================
The application basically consists of two seperate parts: the dependency tree
builder and the cmake-driver. The cmake-driver is the part that is specific to
our problem (finding cross-project deps in kdevplatform). It parses the
CMakeLists.txt files and then feeds each source-file to the dependency tree
builder.

Like I said this is a _real basic_ dependency scanner. All it does is find all
the include directives for a file, attempt to locate them and then recusively
does the same for all found includes.

After all the sources have been 'parsed' the resulting dependency trees are
then analyzed by the cmake-driver and all sub-project dependencies are found
and presented in a nicely formatted HTML document.

For more detail: "Use the source Luke!"


===============================================================================
History
===============================================================================
After writing a rather ugly working version first I decided to start over from
scratch so that the utility could be used more than once and quite possibly be
adapted to be used for other projects.

I don't like ugly code and boy was it ugly before.
I'd really like for my code not to smell when I share it... -sigh-
