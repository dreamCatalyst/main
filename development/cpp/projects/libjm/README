This directory contains several libraries I developed for myself.

Each library comes with it's own README. Please read those files for more
information.


Requirements
------------
a working build-environment
cmake 2.8

Compiling
---------

mkdir build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install (should be added and working if I ever release this)



=======
libjmdb - A single library for interacting with different databases
=======

Optional libraries
------------------
sqlite3
mysql

By default it is assumed that you want to compile against all the optional
libraries. Therefore if one isn't found an error is thrown.

To disable an optional library use either:
cmake -DWITH_SQLITE3:bool=OFF ..
cmake -DWITH_MYSQL:bool=OFF ..


=========
libjmutil - A library containing utility classes and functions
=========
